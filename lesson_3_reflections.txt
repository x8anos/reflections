When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When i'm obliged working from another pc or perhaps i'm sharing a project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Cause i may not want to make public some of my recent changes.
