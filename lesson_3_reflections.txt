When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When i'm obliged working from another pc or perhaps i'm sharing a project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Cause i may not want to make public some of my recent changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
I clone when i just need a copy in my own computer to use it locally with no intension to push it pack on Git.
If i want it as a remote on Github i will fork it. Now i will branch my project if i want to keep to different
storylines of it whith a different path.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You can manipulate changes while offline.
