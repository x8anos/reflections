How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It just did.............

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It would be easier to spot my mistakes periodically and better resolve them.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git,
 vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
 You add a meaning to each different version of your file.

 Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit,
  while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Versioning systems like Git see the whole picture, the project as an entity not one seperate file standing alone.
This way the interconnectioned files take a meaning.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Log gives you the history of all past commits detailed with author , time stamp and commends,
on the other hand diff uses 2 commits and through their id's identifies their differencies and reports them.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
It will possible for me to reverse engineer my mistakes...so more confident!

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Writing code...papers maybe...whatever !!!
