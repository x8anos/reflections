What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A hidden file with metadata info called .git is created and your existing files in your
directory are presumed untracked after a git status command. It's the first step to
create a git project....

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is middle ground / neutro zone or sth. The working directory is a common thing , repository
is about git and the snapshots of your files. With staging area it is possible to make another commit without constantly
copying all the files like previous VC systems.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Cause the staging are is like an intermidiatery collectin stuff and pushing the relevant to repository.
The relevancy here is about logical changes.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
My first thought goes to a case where you need two or more working scenarios, perhaps because you need to test your
product or because you target different groups. In that cases with branches help , you can minimize the problem.
